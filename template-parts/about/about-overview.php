                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">Smart Grant Solutions was born from a simple frustration: watching brilliant organizations struggle with an unnecessarily complex grant process. Our founder, Dayna Shaw Sear, spent years navigating federal funding systems and saw firsthand how administrative barriers were keeping deserving organizations from accessing critical resources.</p>
                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">From the start, our work focused on the financial side of the grant lifecycle—grant-funded financial management, budgeting support, and helping organizations navigate Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200) compliance.</p>
                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">After securing over $2.1 billion in funding across her career, SGS Founder & CEO Dayna Shaw Sear realized the problem wasn't a lack of available funding—it was the maze of compliance requirements, unclear processes, and fragmented systems that made grant management feel impossible.</p>

                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">What began as consulting services has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem. We realized that technology alone wasn't enough—organizations needed both sophisticated tools and human expertise. They needed partners who understood the entire grant lifecycle.</p>
                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">That’s why our MissionGranted platform combines grant budgeting & compliance automation, real-time visibility into spending, and audit-ready documentation across every grant.</p>
                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">Today, Smart Grant Solutions pairs expert consulting with the MissionGranted platform. We combine cutting-edge software with deep institutional knowledge, helping organizations not just win grants, but build sustainable funding strategies that scale with their missions.</p>

                    <h3 class="story-section__title">Looking Forward</h3>
                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">We're building toward a future where grant funding—and the post-award financial management that follows—is accessible, transparent, and strategic. Where organizations spend their time creating impact rather than deciphering compliance requirements. Where the best ideas get funded regardless of administrative capacity.</p>
                    <p class="story-section__paragraph">Every client success story validates our belief that when you remove barriers to funding, you unlock unlimited potential for social impact.</p>
