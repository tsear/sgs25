				MissionGranted automates the heavy grant accounting, but transformation only sticks when processes, people, and policies evolve with it. Our consulting team builds the operating system around the software so compliance isn’t left to chance.

				<h3>Systems before software</h3>
				<p>Automation can streamline tasks, but it can’t repair a broken approval chain or outdated fiscal policy. We map the entire grant lifecycle, then rearchitect the system MissionGranted will run on.</p>

			<article class="consulting-card">
				<h3>Compliance is structure</h3>
				<p>Rules, training, documentation, and accountability are what make compliance real. We codify those guardrails so MissionGranted’s automations have a strong backbone.</p>

			<article class="consulting-card">
				<h3>Fewer tools, better playbooks</h3>
				<p>Most teams aren’t short on software—they’re short on cohesive workflows. We remove redundant tools, align finance and programs, and keep every dollar traceable.</p>
			</article>
			<article class="consulting-card">
				<h3>Human expertise × 3× impact</h3>
				<p>Our consultants bring decades of grant operations experience, making the platform three times more effective by pairing configuration with coaching, training, and change management.</p>
