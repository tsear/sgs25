				<h3>Systems Before Software</h3>
				<p>Automation can streamline tasks, but it can’t fix unclear responsibilities or outdated financial practices. We map your financial workflows, then rearchitect processes, policies, and controls so MissionGranted runs smoothly.</p>

				<h3>Compliance Needs Structure</h3>
				<p>Compliance doesn’t happen by accident. We build the rules, documentation, and training that ensure consistent application of grant requirements, including federal standards like Uniform Guidance.</p>

				<h3>Fewer Tools, Better Playbooks</h3>
				<p>Most teams aren’t missing software, they’re missing clarity. We remove redundant tools, align finance and programs, and establish consistent workflows where every dollar is traceable and every step has an owner.</p>

				<h3>Human Expertise × Real Transformation</h3>
				<p>MissionGranted is powerful, but pairing it with experienced advisers multiplies its effectiveness. Our consultants bring deep grant-finance and compliance expertise to manage organizational change success.</p>
